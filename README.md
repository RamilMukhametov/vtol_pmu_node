### 2. APPLICATION DESCRIPTION AND DESIGN

The PMU node does 3 things:
1. Battery. This module estimates the battery info based on ADC voltage and current measurements and publishes [BatteryInfo](https://dronecan.github.io/Specification/7._List_of_standard_data_types/#batteryinfo) message.
2. Gate monitor. This module estimates the internal state of the PMU based on ADC voltage of gates. It publishes the [LogMessage](https://dronecan.github.io/Specification/7._List_of_standard_data_types/#logmessage) and set `CRITICAL` state once an error is detected.
3. Buzzer. This module notifies with sound if the internal state of the board is bad. If the internal state is fine, it repeats the [BeepCommand](https://dronecan.github.io/Specification/7._List_of_standard_data_types/#beepcommand) from an autopilot.

From the software side, the high level node design can be illustrated with the following UML diagramm:

More details about each module:

#### 2.1. Battery

The battery module sends [BatteryInfo](https://dronecan.github.io/Specification/7._List_of_standard_data_types/#batteryinfo) message with 1 Hz rate.

<img src="Assets/battery_info.png" alt="drawing">

Here:
- `voltage` and `current` are measured values,
- `full_charge_capacity_wh`, `battery_id`, `model_instance_id` are configured via parameters,
- `average_power_10_sec`, `remaining_capacity_wh`,`state_of_charge_pct` are calculated based on the above values.

#### 2.2. Gate monitor checks the gates

If at least one gate is broken, it starts to notify with LogMessage each 10 seconds until the node is rebooted. The LogMessage has a number of broken gates.

The node ignores all broken states first 5 seconds to prevent false positive failures.

| DMA Rank | Periphery   | Pin  | Meaning        | Note |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | -------------- | ---- |
| 1 | ADC_IN2 | PA2 | ADC_GATE_2 | If voltage < 1.4 V, so it is broken. |
| 3 | ADC_IN4 | PA4 | ADC_GATE_3 | If voltage < 1.4 V, so it is broken. |
| 4 | ADC_IN6 | PA6 | ADC_GATE_4 | If voltage < 1.4 V, so it is broken. |

#### 2.3. Buzzer

The buzzer notifies with sound about dead gates.

### 3. PARAMETERS

Here is a list of parameters.

More details you can find in the parameters auto-generated documentation [Src/dronecan_application/README.md](Src/dronecan_application/README.md).

### 4. TEST CASES

1. TestBatteryInfo
    - TC1. Publish rate must be 1 Hz (plus minus 50 ms is acceptable)
    - TC2. Votlage should be within [4.5, 60.0] Volts
    - TC3. Set a random value between [0, 100] `battery.soc_pct`, so `msg.state_of_charge_pct` should be the same
    - TC4. The same for `battery.battery_id`
    - TC5. The same for `battery.model_instance_id`
    - TC6. Similar for pair `battery.capacity_mah` and `battery.full_voltage`, but check `msg.full_charge_capacity_wh` value according to a formula
    - TC7. We should also check `msg.remaining_capacity_wh`. Well, it seems to be we should check it manually.
2. TestBuzzer
    - I don't know how to automatically test it...
4. TestGateMonitor
    - TC1. Test good gate
      Reboot the node.
      Set `gate.threshold` to 4095 (that means gates are always ok).
      Wait for 15 seconds.
      Debug message should not appear.
      The NodeStatus should have good health.
    - TC2. Test bad gates
      Reboot the node.
      Set `gate.threshold` to 0 (that means gates are always bad).
      Verify, that the node publish LogMessage with 0.1 Hz rate (burst publishing are not allowed, first 5 second node publish nothing)
      The NodeStatus should have CRITICAL health.
